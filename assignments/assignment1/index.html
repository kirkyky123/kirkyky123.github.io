  <p>
    Fortnite is a popular online video game developed by Epic Games.<br>
    It is known for its battle royale mode, where players fight each other until only one remains.<br>
    The game features a colorful world, with a variety of weapons, items, and a unique building mechanic that adds depth
    to the gameplay.<br>
    Fortnite also has one of the if not the <strong>biggest</strong> multiverse of any show, movie, or game in history.
  </p>

  <p>
    The success of Fortnite is due to the easy but high skill ceiling game mechanics combined with its
    visuals.<br>
    Being able to play as Spiderman, Eminem, LeBron James, Naruto, or thousands of other iconic characters in the same game is unheard of and plays a big role in Fortnite's success.<br>
    It is available on multiple platforms, including PC, consoles, and mobile devices, allowing players to connect and
    play with friends regardless of their gaming platform.<br>
    Additionally, Epic Games regularly releases new content, such as limited-time events, new game modes, and cosmetic
    items, keeping the game fresh for its large player base.
